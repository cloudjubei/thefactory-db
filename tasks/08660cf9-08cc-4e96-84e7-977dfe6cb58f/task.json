  "description": "Currently we were relying on having a local embedded PostgresSQL database running. But these don't have all the latest functionality that we require (CREATE EXTENSION vector) . We need to modify all the code and especially the README.md to walk a user through 2 options:\n1) having a local PostgresSQL running and providing access to it via url\n2) running PostgresSQL in docker.\nBoth options need to be explained from scratch - for option 2 assuming the user has docker installed, but for option 1 assuming they have nothing.",
