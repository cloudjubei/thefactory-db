Implemented embedded PostgreSQL lifecycle management using pg-embedded in src/connection.ts with ensureEmbeddedPostgres(). Updated openPostgres to start embedded server when databaseDir is provided or no connection string is supplied. Extended OpenOptions accordingly and updated src/index.ts to pass databaseDir through. Updated docs to describe new behavior and default data directory.
